            AFL is a dynamic sport unlike any other in the world, where the bottom team is always a chance to upset the top team in any given week. 
            Every team has a story each season, with a mix of highs and lows. Explore the statistics which have defined your club's history

          <p style = "color:white; font-size: 20px; padding-right: 30px;">
          Clubs go through high and low patches throughout any season. There are a number of reasons for this, as explored in the charts below. <br> <br>
          In Richmond's 2017 premiership year, they were dominant for most of the season. However, they did get beaten by nearly 70 points on two seperate occasions, one of which was against Adelaide, who they defeated in the Grand Final. <br> <br><br> <br>
          Player height is important for several reasons. AFL involves lots of aerial contests and marks where being taller in benefical for marking the ball, However, smaller players tend to be faster and more skillfull. <br> <br>
          In Richmond's 2017 premiership year the fielded team for the majority of games was smaller than the opposition by several centimeters on average. This suited the Tiger's gamestyle, which relyed on frenetic pressure. <br> <br> <br><br>
          Age of the team is another important factor, with younger teams often having greater stamina but older teams havign more experiance and game knowldege. <br> <br>
          Richmond had a relatively junior side for the majority of their 2017 season, only fielding a more experianced side on four occasions during the season. <br> <br> <br><br>

              Compare how your team performs against the other teams in the competition <br> <br>
              From all the data collected between 2012-2020, trends in which teams have been most succesful emerge. <br> <br>
              Hawthorn, Geelong and Sydney can be seen to be the most succesful teams in this period, with each only having two teams which have a greater avergae margin against them <br> <br>
              Conversely, Gold Coast, Melbourne and Carlton have been the least successful teams, only having postive average margins against 1, 2 and 3 teams respectively. <br> <br>

              "Wet Weather footy" is a term thrown around alot, describing the different playstyle required to handle a slippery ball. <br> <br>
              During their premiership streak, Richmond were renowned for their ability to play in the wet. This trend can be seen in their 2017 season, where their average margin increased as the rainfall did. <br> <br>

            <p style = "color:white; font-size: 20px;">
              Home ground advantage is often a factor in sports discussion across the world. This is particularly true for AFL, where not only do you have the majority of the fans but also are used to the pitch, as not all AFL playing surfaces have the same dimensions <br> <br>
              Geelong has its home ground at Kardinia Park and has the highest avergae margin at a home ground in the competion, with not a single other team having a postive margin at that ground <br> <br>
              Interestingly, 8 of the 18 teams have a negative margin at their home ground. This may be because several teams share home grounds.
